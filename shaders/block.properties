#    XorDev's "Default Shaderpack"
#
#    This was put together by @XorDev to make it easier for anyone to make their own shaderpacks in Minecraft (Optifine).
#    You can do whatever you want with this code! Credit is not necessary, but always appreciated!
#
#    You can find more information about shaders in Optfine here:
